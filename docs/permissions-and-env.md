# Permissions & env setup
The CaaS operator configures the permissions and the environment in a way that it can be immediately used. If you require custom configuration, follow the instructions below.

## ArgoCD
Cluster as a service operator uses the abilities of ArgoCD to deploy and manage cluster installation and cluster setup. The CaaS operator, by default, creates an ArgoCD instance with all the necessary configuration and permissions. However, we do not recommend using this instance in production environments. Instead create your own and use **claas-config** config map to point CaaS operator to it.

## Minimal set of permissions for ClusterTemplateInstance users
Minimal permissions on the hub cluster are:
 - Access to at least 1 namespace.
 - **Read** for **ClusterTemplate** - so users can explore the template (ie description) or the status which contains Helm chart's values and values schema if there are any.
 - **Read** for **ClusterTemplateQuota** - so users can understand which templates can be used & what is the available budget
 - **CRUD permissions** for **ClusterTemplateInstance**
 - **Read permissions** for **secrets** of **ClusterTemplateInstance** (kubeconfig and admin credentials)

## Default ClusterRoles
The cluster as a service operator creates 2 ClusterRole-s by default:
 - **cluster-templates-user** - You can use this ClusterRole to give permissions to ClusterTemplateInstance and ClusterTemplateQuota. Following RoleBiding adds the permissions to foo-user in devclusters namespace:
```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: cluster-templates-user-rb
  namespace: devclusters
subjects:
  - kind: User
	apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
	name: foo-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-templates-user
```
 - **cluster-templates-user-ct** - You can use this ClusterRole to give permissions for ClusterTemplate. Since ClusterTemplate is cluster-scoped resource, you need to create ClusterRoleBinding. Following ClusterRoleBiding adds the permissions to foo-user:
```
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: cluster-templates-user-crb
subjects:
  - kind: User
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    name: foo-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-templates-user-ct
```

## Dynamic permissions for ClusterTemplateInstance secrets
When a new cluster is created (via ClusterTemplateInstance), the operator will dynamically create Role and RoleBinding for any user that is bound to the cluster-templates-role, giving the user access only to secrets referenced by the new cluster (kubeconfig and admin credentials). When ClusterTemplateInstance is deleted, the dynamically created Role and RoleBiding are deleted too.
